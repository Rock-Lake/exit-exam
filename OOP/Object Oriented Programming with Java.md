# Introduction
Structured Programming involves organizing processes into procedures that perform a specific task. This raises the following limitations:
- **Tight coupling:** any changes in one part of the code can affect the entire program.
- **Poor Real-world Modeling:** functions and data are unrelated to the state of real-world provide a poor model of the real world.
- **Limited Data Type:** the traditional data types may not be enough for real scenarios.
- **Tight memory management:** procedural code often requires manual memory management, which can lead to memory leaks

Object oriented programming allows the programmer to break down a program into self contained entities that hold both data and operations called **Objects**.

Here are the basic concepts of object-oriented programming:
- [[Objects]]
- [[Class]]
- [[Data Abstraction]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Polymorphism]]
