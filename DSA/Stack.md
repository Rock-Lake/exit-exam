A stack is an ordered [[List|list]] that follows the **First-In-Last-Out**(FILO) interaction; this means any insertion or deletion can occur from the last index of the list called the **top**.

Stacks have the following operations:
-  **Push** To add an element to the stack
-  **Pop** To remove an element from the stock
-  **Peek** To look at elements in the stack without removing them

Stacks can be implemented in [[Array|arrays]](static memory) or [[Linked List|linked lists]](dynamic memory) and are useful in operations that require backtracking such as:
- Recursion
