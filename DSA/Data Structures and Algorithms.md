This course focuses on teaching the foundations of writing clean and efficient code using well-understood and tested techniques.

# Introduction

The measure of a program's performance is usually time and space(memory) usage. The time usage, also defined as execution speed; is the amount of time it takes the program to compute instructions. Ignoring hardware restrictions, some programs can perform faster even running on the same hardware and working the same problem. This is usually depend on how the program organizes the data required to solve the problem and the sequence of steps it took to solve the problem.

# Data Structures

There are many data structures used to efficiently store, access and modify data; each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Choosing a data structure, not only change how the program interacts with the data, but also drastically affect the program's performance.

Here are popular data structures:
- [[Array]]

Many data structures are used(operated) in 4 basic ways:
- **Read** - look a particular spot in the data structure ^70d2a5
- **Search** - check for a value within the data structure ^e63471
- **Insert** - Add a new value to the data structure ^8c0303
- **Delete** - remove a value from the data structure ^2d8491

# Algorithms

An algorithms is a set of instructions for completing a specific task.  ^854a22
