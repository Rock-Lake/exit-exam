A string is a programmer-defined datatype, where it contains a sequence of zero or more characters. Strings in C++ are enclosed in quotation marks. A string containing no characters in a *null* or *empty* string.

Like [[Array|arrays]], every character in a string has a relative position in the string starting from 0, left-to-right.
