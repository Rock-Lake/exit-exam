Start with [[Introduction]].md to read and update the notes.

## Writing recommendations
When creating new notes please follow these general rules:
1. Separate the notes into topics rather than chapters.
2. Only create a separate note if the topic/sub-topic is large to warrant its own space.
3. All notes should have at least one link connecting to another note.
