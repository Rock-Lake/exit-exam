System calls are routines written in either assembly or high-level languages such as [[Programming Fundamentals with C++|C++]] that provide an interface to services in an operating system. There are many system calls that operate in most operating system environments and they can be divided into:
- **Process control** - end, abort, load, execute, create process, terminate process...
- **File management** - create file, delete file, open, close, read, write, reposition...
- **Device management** - request device, release device, get attributes, set attributes...
- **Information maintenance** - get time or date, set time or date, get process, set process...
- **Communications** - create or delete connections, send or receive messages, status information...

However most programmers don't use system calls directly as they can be different in several operating system. To solve this, application developers design program based on an **application programming interface(API)**.
- Windows uses Win32API
- UNIX based systems such as Linux and Mac OS uses POSIX API
- [[Object Oriented Programming with Java|Java Virtual Machine]] uses Java API
