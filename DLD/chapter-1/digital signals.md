**Digital Signals**Â are representations of data that convey information using discrete levels or states, typically within a binary format (0s and 1s). Unlike analog signals, which vary continuously over time, digital signals maintain a fixed number of levels, making them more robust for processing and transmitting information.

Digital signals and binary logic gates work hand-in-hand in the functioning of digital circuits and systems. Digital signals provide the binary inputs and outputs that logic gates manipulate to perform logical operations, enabling complex computations, data processing, and control functions in a variety of applications.

### **Examples of Digital Signal Types**

- **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**: A method used to digitally represent analog signals, where the amplitude of the signal is sampled at uniform intervals.
    
- **Binary Signals**: The simplest digital signal, representing information using only two states, usually denoted as 0 and 1.
    
- **Encoded Signals**: Various methods to encode data in digital formats, such as Manchester encoding or Non-return to Zero (NRZ), which provide specific timing and transmission benefits.
