ADC: Analog-to-Digital Converter

**Definition**: An Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is a device that converts continuous analog signals (such as voltage) into discrete digital signals (represented by binary numbers).

 How It Works

1. **Sampling**: The ADC samples the analog signal at regular intervals. The frequency of sampling determines how accurately the analog signal is represented in digital form.
    
2. **Quantization**: Each sampled value is then quantized, meaning it is rounded to the nearest value within a set range of discrete values.
    
3. **Encoding**: Finally, the quantized values are encoded into binary format, producing a digital output.
    

Applications

- **Audio Processing**: Converting sound waves into digital audio files.
- **Image Processing**: Transforming light intensity from images into digital pixels.
- **Data Acquisition Systems**: Collecting and processing data from sensors in various fields like engineering and medical devices.

### Importance

- ADCs are essential for interfacing analog real-world signals with digital systems, enabling the use of digital processing techniques for applications like control systems, signal processing, and telecommunications.
