**Binary Logic** is a system of mathematical logic that uses two values,[[digital signals]] typically represented as **0** (false) and **1** (true). It forms the basis for digital circuits and computer systems, where operations like AND, OR, and NOT manipulate these binary values to perform complex computations.

### Applications of Binary Logic

- **Computer Programming**: Logic gates and binary logic forms the basis for conditional statements (if-else).
- **Digital Circuits**: Circuits like adders, multiplexers, and memory devices rely heavily on binary logic.
- **Data Representation**: Everything from numbers to characters is encoded in binary form in computers (e.g., ASCII).


In essence, binary logic provides the foundational framework that allows digital systems to process, store, and transmit information effectively and reliably. The principles of binary logic ensure that all operations in [[digital systems]] can be sorted, prioritized, and executed logically.
