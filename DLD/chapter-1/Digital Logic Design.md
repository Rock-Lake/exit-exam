 ### **Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Systems**

## Overview

- Digital systems are vital in various fields like science, technology, and business.
- Quantities can be represented in two ways: **analog** and **digital**.

## Analog vs. Digital Systems

### Analog Representation

- Continuous representation (e.g., voltage, current).
- Example: Analog watches show time continuously.

### Digital Representation

- Discrete representation using symbols (digits).
- Example: Digital watches show time in steps (e.g., every minute).

### Key Differences

- **Analog**: Continuous
- **Digital**: Discrete

## Advantages of Digital Systems

1. **Easier Design**: [[Easier Design]]
2. **Efficient Information Storage**: [[Efficient Information Storage]]
3. **Greater Accuracy and Precision**: [[Greater Accuracy and Precision]]
4. **Versatility through Programmable Operations**: [[Versatility through Programmable Operations]]
5. **Less Affected by Noise**: [[Less Affected by Noise]]

## Limitations of Digital Techniques

- The primary limitation is that the real world is mostly analog.
- Requires conversion between analog and digital forms:
    1. **ADC**: Analog-to-Digital Conversion[[ADC]]
    2. **Processing**: Digital data manipulation[[processing]]
    3. **DAC**: Digital-to-Analog Conversion[[DAC]]

 Binary Logic Gates[[binary logic gates]]

- Basic building blocks of digital circuits.
- Operate on binary numbers (0s and 1s).

# Digital Signals 

- Use two voltage levels to represent binary digits.
    - **Positive Logic**: 1 = HIGH (+5V), 0 = LOW (0V).
    - **Negative Logic**: 0 = HIGH (+5V), 1 = LOW (0V).

## Waveform Characteristics

- Digital waveforms can be **periodic** or **nonperiodic**.
- **Duty Cycle**: Ratio of pulse width to period, expressed as a percentage.
