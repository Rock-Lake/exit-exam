# Introduction

Digital systems are vital in various fields like science, technology, and business due to their ability to store, process and communicate discrete information accurately. Electronic systems use one of two types of signals, each having their own benefits and challenges.

| Type                   |       Analog Signals       | Digital Signals |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------: | :-------------: |
| Data representation    | continious (Ex: 1.2478...) | discrete (1,0)  |
| Accuracy               |           medium           |      high       |
| Precision              |            low             |      high       |
| Noise sensitivity      |            high            |       low       |
| Real-world application |           simple           |    moderate     |

Digital systems can have the following advantages:
1. **Easier Design**: its binary representation simplifies circuit design and troubleshooting, making it more straightforward to implement logic functions.
2. **Efficient Information Storage**: its usage of [[semiconductor memory]] allows for efficient storage of information in a compact form.
3. **Greater Accuracy and Precision**: The discrete property of digital signals allows for precise and accurate data for measurement and processing.
4. **Versatility through Programmable Operations**: digital systems are versatile in changing its function by simply changing the program used to operate the system.
5. **Less Affected by Noise**: The discrete property of digital signals allows for signal integrity against noise.

## Limitations of Digital Techniques

- The primary limitation is that the real world is mostly analog.
- Requires conversion between analog and digital forms:
    1. **ADC**: Analog-to-Digital Conversion[[ADC]]
    2. **Processing**: Digital data manipulation[[processing]]
    3. **DAC**: Digital-to-Analog Conversion[[DAC]]

 Binary Logic Gates[[binary logic gates]]

- Basic building blocks of digital circuits.
- Operate on binary numbers (0s and 1s).

# Digital Signals 

- Use two voltage levels to represent binary digits.
    - **Positive Logic**: 1 = HIGH (+5V), 0 = LOW (0V).
    - **Negative Logic**: 0 = HIGH (+5V), 1 = LOW (0V).

## Waveform Characteristics

- Digital waveforms can be **periodic** or **nonperiodic**.
- **Duty Cycle**: Ratio of pulse width to period, expressed as a percentage.
