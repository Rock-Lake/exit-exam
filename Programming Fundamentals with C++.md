# Introduction

Problems that occur day-to-day can be solved in various ways. However, all solution require to go through a formal problem solving method. They are:
- **Defining the Problem:** We must understand the specifics of the problem. Its root cause and the behavior of the expected solution; the required data and the procedures needed to achieve the result are necessary to create a picture of the problem.
- **Planning the Solution:** dividing the problem into a number of smaller sub-problem to be solved with a precise method; a set of well defined steps called an [[algorithm]]. This results in a series of steps written in normal language and some mathematical notations called a **pseudo-code**.
- **Coding the Program:** Since we can't copy the pseudo-code into the computer and expect it work, we have to translate it into a [[programming language]]. There are various programming languages with different [[syntax rules]].
- **Testing the Program:** Most programs can't run perfectly the first time; they can produce errors based on the programmer's fault or in its logic. These errors are detected during testing the program, and appropriate revision must be made. This process of repeatedly coding and testing is called **implementation**
- **Documentation:** Humans unlike computers can't remember every little detail about their experiences, thus compiling related documents throughout the program development is essential. The documentation should include:
	- Problem Definition
	- Explaining the steps of the algorithm
	- The problems encountered during the coding and testing of the program
	- Explanation of important or ambiguous parts of the program, usually through [[comments]] on the code.
	- a written copy of the program
	- a user manual of the program's usage
Now that we have a basic understanding of solving a problem through a program, let us see its implementation through [[C++]].
