Syntax tree, also known as parse tree is the result of a parsing a sentence generated by a given grammar.
There are three types of parsers for grammars:
1. **[[Universal parsing]] methods**: algorithms that can parse any grammar, but are too inefficient to use in production compilers.
2. **[[Top-Down parsing]] methods**: it builds the parse tree from the root node to the leaf node. This works on [[LL grammars]] which can be hand implemented.
3. **[[Bottom-Up parsing]] methods**: it builds the trees from the leaf nodes up to the root node. This works on [[LR grammars]] which can constructed by automated tools.
**NB**: Both the 2nd and 3rd parsing method scan the input left to right.
